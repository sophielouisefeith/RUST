“Rust is a systems programming language focused on three goals: safety, speed, and concurrency.”

**A compiled language** 

A compiled language is a programming language whose implementations are typically compilers (translators that generate machine code from source code), and not interpreters (step-by-step executors of source code, where no pre-runtime translation takes place).

The term is somewhat vague. In principle, any language can be implemented with a compiler or with an interpreter.[1] A combination of both solutions is also common: a compiler can translate the source code into some intermediate form (often called p-code or bytecode), which is then passed to an interpreter which executes it.

## SINGLE LINKED LIST

Why use a linked list:


- `cargo new linked-list`
- `cd linked-list`
